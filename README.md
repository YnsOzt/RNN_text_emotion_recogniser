# RNN_text_emotion_recogniser
This is a simple project that uses Recurrent Neural Network to predict the emotion(joy, anger, fear, sadness, happy or love) of a sentence.

# Dataset
Link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/eray1yildiz/emotion-classification

# More information
This model is obviously not the best, it's just a simple RNN model to see what a simple RNN is capable of with the dataset

# TODOs:
* Use attention model over texts
